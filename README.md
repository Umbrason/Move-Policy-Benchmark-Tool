# Move Policy Benchmark Tool
Contains efficient C# implementations of Trailmax, (A-)TRAP, and STMTA*, as well as a map importer for png maps and text maps in the format of movingai.com's 2D Grid Benchmarks.
Requires a free Unity 3D installation to configure benchmark scenarios.

To just run the default configuration without installing Unity, a windows executable file can be found in the release section.

The unity project also contains a visualization tool for individual scenario configurations in the "Visualization/VisualizedGame" Scene.
This tool is not available as a standalone file.
